# Employee-Generator

## Overview ##

This application generates employees and their crucial information. The process begins with asking the manager to put in basic information related to their job. After the manager's data has been created, the app prompts the user to generate their team as is or to add in additional employees. If the user takes the route of adding employees, they are first asked to choose which type of position, intern or engineer, they would like to add.
