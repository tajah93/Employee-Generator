## Overview ##

This application generates employees and their work-related information. The process begins by asking the manager to put in basic information related to their job. After the manager's data has been created, the app prompts the user to generate their team as is or to add in additional employees. If the user takes the route of adding employees, they are first asked to choose which type of position, intern or engineer, they would like to add. Some data will be different depending on the employee's role. When the user is done building their team, information cards are produced for each employee.
